My goal is to use convolutional neural network (cnn) to identify 90 different animals. The data set used here can be found on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/iamsouravbanerjee/animal-image-dataset-90-different-animals). 
The following analysis is organized as follow. Firstly, I import and pre-process the pictures by renaming them. Secondly, I create three folders 'test', 'train' and 'valid' with the picture randomly chosen. Thirdly, I build a CNN model to identify the 90 different animals provided in the data set. Finally, I train and test the CNN model and visualize the results by plotting the confusion matrix.
